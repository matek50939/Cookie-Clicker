This is the git to my cookie clicker game in python. You have to click the cookie to get money and you can upgrade it. there is also a shop where you can buy an auto clicker and upgrade it. To play go tho the itch.io link. It is web playable, or download it and then play on a python complier (pycharm is the best one, others might not work). Also you might need to install some modules such as pygame and asyncio(the module for making it web playable) to install the modules go to the terminal and type "pip install pygame" and then "pip install asyncio". I presonally recommend playing on itch.io on the browser.https://matek50939.itch.io/cookie-clicker Have fun!
